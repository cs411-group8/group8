Readme for the proj03_test program.

To compile the proj03_test program, simply invoke gcc on it:

> gcc proj03_test.c -o proj03_test

To use the program as to test the validity of the best-fit slob allocation,
use the program against both the best-fit slob allocator and the first-fit
slob allocator.  Run the program as soon as the kernel boots to maintain similar
comparisons.

When we ran the test program against the first-fit slob allocator, we recorded
the following fragmentation results:

Slob_amt_claimed: 2969600
Slob_amt_free: 236668

Which is effectively a ratio of approximately 0.079, or 7.9% fragmentation.

When we ran the test program against the best-fit slob allocator, we recorded
the following fragmentation results:

Slob_amt_claimed: 2867200
Slob_amt_free: 163576

Which is effectively a ratio of approximately 0.057, or 5.7% fragmentation.

Thus, it can be shown that the best-fit slob allocator has approximately 28%
better fragmentation performance than the first-fit slob allocator.
